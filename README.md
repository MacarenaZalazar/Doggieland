# DOGGIELAND

This is a SPA (Single Page Application) that I developed as an individual project for soyHenry's bootcamp, with an api (The Dog Api) and:
- Javascript
- Node.js 
- PostgreSQL
- Express
- Sequelize 
- React
- CSS
<br/>
This App will show you dog breeds and let you create your own.
To make it work in your computer, you'll need to:
- Install PostgreSQl
- Create a database call 'dogs'
- Write all of your credentials in a .env file
- Do _npm install_ and _npm start_ in the *api* folder
- Do _npm install_ and _npm start_ in the *client* folder

You're all set!
